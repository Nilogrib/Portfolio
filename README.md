This is my personal portfolio website built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It showcases my skills as a web developer, competitive programmer, and my proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The site includes various sections such as an introduction, featured projects, and contact information. Each project card highlights the technology stack used and provides links to live demos and source code. The responsive design ensures optimal viewing across different devices. The homepage introduces me with a dynamic, typed introduction and provides links to my social media profiles and currently used technologies. The clean, modern design and interactive elements are implemented using the powerful combination of React and Tailwind CSS.
